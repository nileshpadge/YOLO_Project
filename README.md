# YOLOv8 Object Detection on Video

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8n model from the Ultralytics library on a local video file (`kid.mp4`). It visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Uses pre-trained YOLOv8n model (`yolov8n.pt`)
- Detects objects in video frames
- Displays bounding boxes and labels with confidence scores
- Runs in real-time using OpenCV
- Custom color for each class

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
